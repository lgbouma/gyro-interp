The CSVs in this subdirectory contain the manually selected regions defining
the "slow sequences" for open clusters of various ages.

The glue sessions correspond to absolute paths saved on LGB's system (which
will not work elsewhere).

The relevant output is the source-id's in the CSV files, which are visualized
in the PNG files.

For NGC-6819 and Ruprecht-147, these "slow sequences" are just identical to the
"flag_benchmark_period" flag.
