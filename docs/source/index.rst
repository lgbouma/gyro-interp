gyro-interp
++++++++++++

Hi!  Welcome to the documentation for ``gyrointerp``, a Python package that
calculates gyrochronal ages by interpolating between open cluster rotation
sequences.

``gyrointerp`` packages the model from Bouma, Palumbo & Hillenbrand (2023) 
into a fast and easy-to-use framework.  The documentation below will walk you
through the most common use-cases.  For brevity, we'll refer to that paper as
BPH23.

This package is designed to meet the needs of working astronomers with
interests in gyrochronal age measurement, and we encourage community
involvement.  If you find a bug or would like to request a feature, please do
create an `issue on Github <https://github.com/lgbouma/gyro-interp>`_.

journals; the submitted version is available `at this
