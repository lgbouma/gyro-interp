gyro-interp!
============

Hello!  Welcome to the documentation for ``gyrointerp``, a Python package that
calculates gyrochronal ages by interpolating between open cluster rotation
sequences.

``gyrointerp`` packages the model from Palumbo, Bouma & Hillenbrand (2023) 
into a fast and easy-to-use framework.  The examples below will walk you
through the most common use-cases for the code.

``gyrointerp`` is designed to meet the needs of working astronomers with
interests in gyrochronal age measurement, and we encourage community
involvement.  If you find a bug or want to request a feature, please create an
`issue on Github <https://github.com/lgbouma/gyro-interp>`_.
