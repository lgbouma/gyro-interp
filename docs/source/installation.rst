Installation
============

``gyrointerp`` works in Python>3.6.  To use the code, first make sure you have
the latest versions of the "standard astro stack" installed. With ``pip``, you
can do this with the command:

.. code-block:: bash
  
    $ pip install numpy astropy pandas scipy --upgrade

Next, install ``gyrointerp``:

.. code-block:: bash
  
    $ pip install gyrointerp

We recommend installing and running ``gyrointerp`` in a conda virtual
environment.  You can install anaconda or miniconda `here
<https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_; the instructions `here
<https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`_ provide
more information about conda virtual environments.
